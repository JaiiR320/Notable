## Intelligent Agent
- imitates human behavior and thought
- intelligence = perceive + analyze + react
- act humanly, think humanly
- act rationally, think rationally
- Intelligent agents percieve, understands, then acts rationally to maxamize utiity
- no conscousness

- autonomously interacts with an environment to optimize or achieve a goal
- uses a loss function or utility function to determine expected performance value
- performance metric (goals, accuracy, correctness) used to evaluate efectiveness
- can also interact with other agents
- percieves the state of the environment through sensors
- acts upon states using actuators
- Perception-Effect Cycle


## Environment
### fully/partially observable
fully observable if the state is accessable at any point, and fully accessable. Chess/checkers vs poker

### deterministic/non-deterministic(stochastic)
the next state is completely determined by the current state and the next actions of the agent. tic tac toe vs self driving car 

### eposodic/sequential
eposodic when each action/task is independent of the previous episode. sorting mail vs chess

### static/dynamic
static when environment never changes. crossword vs soccer game

### discrete/continuous
when actions or states are distinct and clearly defined. chess vs self driving car

### single/multiple agents
single when only one agent. crossword vs soccer game

Simple Reflex Agent
assumes environment is fullly observable

Model-based Reflex Agents
Keeps a state of the world 
agent's best guess
cannot see picture the whole time, needs memory to memorize what has been seen so far
