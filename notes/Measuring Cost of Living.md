# Measuring Cost of Living
CPI - consumer price index
inflation - economy's overall price level is rising
inflation rate - % change
deflation bad

CPI - measures the overall cost of goods for a typical consumer
- decide what a typical consumer will consume (basket)
- find prices of goods
- compute basket cost
- choose base year, then compare

Inflation = CPI 2 - CPI 1 / CPI 1 * 100


not perfect, overstates the true cost of living

Substitution bias
- as prices go up, you switch to a different product
- goods that are substituted are not accounted

Unmeasured Quality Changes
- price of goods stay the same
- quality changes
- price is adjusted for consistent quality, so it is missing 

GDP deflator vs CPI
- both measure inflation
- deflator looks at entire economy
- CPI reflects the basket

PPI
- cost of basket bought by firms

Core CPI
- consumer goods excluding food and energy

Nominal intrest rate usually reported and not corrected for inflation
Real intrest rate = nominal intrest rate - inflation
