# Measuring a Nations Income
## expenditure = income
![](@attachment/Clipboard_2022-11-04-12-24-01.png)

### GDP = Gross Domestic Product
- measures all income and expenditures in economy
- a price is attatched to all objects, and added up to get market value
- GDP only counts legally sold items, once something becomes legal then GDP spikes instantly
- excludes items produced and consumed outside of the marketplace (veggies in garden)
- intermediate goods are not counted unless not used by end of year
- apple orchard, sells apples to people, sells to factory that makes cider
- final product is apple cider, not apples
- includes goods and services which are produced within a certain period
- buying used car not part of GDP
- measured within geographic confines of the country
- nationality of producer or owner of factory didn't matter
- seasonally adjusted

GDP = C + I + G + NX
- Consumption, Investment, Government purchases, Net Exports

Consumption
- spending of households for goods and services besides new houses

Investment
- spending capital on equipment, inventories, and structures
- new houses

Government Purchases
- spending on goods and services by local and central government
- includes salaries of govt. workers
- does not include transfer payments

Net Exports
- NX = exports-imports
- spending on domestically produced goods by foreigners (exports) minus spending on foreign goods by domestic residents (imports)

GDP per capita = GDP/population, average national income per person

Nominal vs Real
nominal is based on current prices
real is based on prices of a certain year
economic growth is measured as % change of real GDP from year to year
EG = 100 * (real2 - real1) / real1

GDP deflator = nominal/real * 100
tells how much nominal gdp is inflated by production
if above 1, then inflation, if below 1, deflation. if nominal>=real, then inflation

inflation = (deflator2 - deflator1) / deflator1 * 100

### Recession
- 2 consecutive quarters of falling GDP
- real GDP declines
- lower income
- rising unemploymen
- falling profits
- increased bankruptcies
