Oppurtunity cost - charges more because values time more
surplus comes from oppurtunity cost
as prices go up, producer surplus increases

### Review
Consumer Surplus: value to buyers - amount paid by buyers
Producer Surplus: amount recieved by sellers - cost to sellers

Total Surplus: consumer surplus + prodicer surplus
or
Value to buyers - cost to sellers

when government intervenes, they adjust the market to account for issues of equity
laissez faire - government should not intervene due to reduction in effeciency
