phillips curve
central bank oversee banking institution and monitor money
commercial anks influence money supply and quantity of demand deposits

T-Account, accepts deposits, keeps portion as reserve, lends out rest
loans increase money supply
if you deposit 100 and reserve rate is 10%, the bank holds onto 90, and can loan out 90, meaining that there is 190 in supply

Money multiplier = 1/R or reserve requirement
rate = 10%, 1/.1 = 10, if you start with 100, you end with 1000

central bank has 3 operations
open market operations, selling bonds, returned at a certain time
selling bonds decrease money supply, buying increases
refinancing rate, money that banks can borrow through the central bank
the cost of capital for banks
quantity of easing, injects money to system
problems of money supply, not precise because the central bank does not control the amount of money that households choose oto hold as deposits in banks
