# Money Growth and Inflation

## Classical Theory of Inflation
Key Point: Inflation is an economy-wide phenomenon that concerns the value of the economy's medium of exchange.

 - price level determined by price of bucket of goods and services (remember CPI). When bucket price increases, you have ot pay more for the same stuff
 - price level measured by the value of money. A rise in price level means the value of the money drops because each dollar buys less stuff

 P = price level measured by CPI or GDP deflator. measures price of basket of goods

 money supply is a policy variable controlled by the feds through things like open market operations (bonds)
 money demand reflects how much money people want in liquid form
 higher prices means higher money demand
 has determinants:
  - interest rates
  - avg level of prices in the economy

Equilibrium exists between price of goods and value of money
when fed increases quantity of money, price rises and value decreases

injection of money increases demand for goods, allows loans to be taken and money saved in accounts

quantity theory of money - qty of money avaliable determines price level/value of money
primary cause of inflation is increase of qty of money

**Nominal Variables** - measured in monetary units

**Real Variables** - measured in physical units

**velocity of money** - the speed at which money changes hands
V = (P*Y)/M
V - velocity
P - price level
Y - qty of output in real terms
M - qty of money

Fisher effect - n = r + i, nominal interest rate = real interest rate + inflation rate

purchase power falls with inflation
possible that income rises as prices rise
inflation itself does not reduce real purchasing power 


### Shoe Leather Costs
- inflation reduces real value of money, people minimize cash holdings
- less cash requires more trips to the bank, meaning wasting time 
- cost of reducing money holdings is the time and convenience sacraficesd to keep less on hand
- Shoeleather costs are the resources wasted when inflation encourages people to reduce their money holdings

### Menu Costs
- during inflation, must update prices
- resource consuming task that takes away time
- Menu Costs are the costs of adjusting prices

### Relative Price Variability and Misallocation or Resources
- inflation distorts relative prices because not all update at same time
- consumer decisions are distorted and markets less able to allocate resources correctly

### Inflation Induces Tax Distortion
- Taxes are imposed on nominal interest earnings not real interest

### Confusion and Inconvenience
- Inflation causes things to have different prices at different prices
- money loses meaning as a unit of account

### Special Cost of Unexpected Inflation: Arbitrary Redistribution of Wealth
- Inflation good for someone who owes money, bad for lender
